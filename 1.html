    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">For 1955, the Ford Fairlane was introduced as the premium Ford model range. Slotted above the Victoria two-door hardtop, the Crown Victoria debuted as the flagship trim of the Fairlane. In place of the popular hardtop roofline, the Crown Victoria was fitted with a B-pillared roofline. Similar to the Mercury XM-800 concept car (though changed in angle), the B-pillar was fitted with a wide stainless steel band ("crowning" the roof), giving a sleeker appearance to the roofline,
      Alongside the standard two-tone roof, the Crown Victoria Skyliner was fitted with a fixed sunroof, a tinted acrylic glass panel formed the entire roof ahead of the B-pillar.[5]
      For 1956, the Lifeguard option package was introduced as an option for the Fairlane Crown Victoria (as with all Ford cars).[6]
      For the 1957 redesign of the Ford model line, the Crown Victoria was retired from the Fairlane series with no replacement. The Skyliner name made its return in a different form, denoting the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner retractable hardtop convertible.
